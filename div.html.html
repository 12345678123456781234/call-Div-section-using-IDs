            <h4>Paul Gauguin</h4>
            <p>
              Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin, was a French Post-Impressionist artist. 
              Unappreciated until after his death, Gauguin is now recognized for 
              his experimental use of color and Synthetist style that were 
              distinct from Impressionism. Toward the end of his life, he 
              spent ten years in French Polynesia. The paintings from this 
              time depict people or landscapes from that region.
